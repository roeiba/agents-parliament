The best workflow for AI Art just got automated. 🎨

Usually:
1. Ask Claude for a prompt
2. Copy prompt to Midjourney/Gemini
3. Paste image back to context

Now with Agents Parliament:
"Claude, generate an image of X"
→ Claude calls Gemini via MCP
→ Image appears in chat

Best of both worlds: Claude's reasoning + Gemini's generation.
