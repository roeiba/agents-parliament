Target: #BuildInPublic (https://x.com/search?q=%23BuildInPublic)

Built this over New Year's Eve 🎆

I was tired of switching tabs between Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT to get the best results.

So I built a tool to let them call each other.

Ask Claude for an image → calls Gemini → Done.
Refactoring? → Delegates to Aider → Done.

Shipped it as open source: "Agents Parliament" 🏛️
