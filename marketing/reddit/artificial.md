**Title:** AI assistants that call each other — Agents Parliament

What if instead of switching between different AI tools, they could just work together?

**Agents Parliament** makes this happen:
- Ask Claude to create an image → Claude calls Gemini → Image done
- Need specialized help → One AI delegates to another

Each AI assistant has different strengths. Now they combine them automatically.
