**Title:** Built this over New Year's Eve — AI tools that work together instead of you switching between them

Got frustrated switching between Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini to get the best of each.

So I made them collaborate automatically.

🏛️ **Agents Parliament** lets AI assistants call each other:
- Ask Claude for an image → Claude calls Gemini → Done
- Need code help → Claude delegates to a specialist → Done

Each AI has different strengths. Now they combine them.

Free, open source, built in a weekend.

Would love feedback from fellow builders!
