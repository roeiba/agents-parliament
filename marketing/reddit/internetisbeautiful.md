**Title:** Agents Parliament — AI assistants that call each other

Instead of you switching between ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini — they can now collaborate.

**Example:** Ask Claude to create an image. Claude can't generate images, but Gemini can. So Claude calls Gemini, gets the image, returns it.

Best of every AI, combined.
