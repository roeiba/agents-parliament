**Title:** Agents Parliament — AI assistants that collaborate instead of you switching between them

What if ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini could work together?

**Agents Parliament** makes AI assistants call each other:
- Ask Claude for an image → Claude calls Gemini → Image generated
- Need code help → One AI delegates to a specialist

Each AI has strengths. Now they combine automatically.
