**Title:** Built Agents Parliament over New Year's Eve — AI agents that work together

Got tired of switching between Claude, Gemini, and Aider. So I made them talk to each other instead.

🏛️ **Agents Parliament** lets AI coding agents call each other:

- Ask Claude for an image → Claude calls Gemini → Done
- Need a refactor → Claude delegates to Aider → Done

Supports Claude, Gemini, Codex, Aider, and Goose.

Would love feedback!
