**Title:** Stop switching between AI tools — I made them work together

Tired of copying between ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to get the best results?

I built something over New Year's Eve: **Agents Parliament** — it lets AI assistants call each other automatically.

**Example:** 
- Ask Claude to create an image → Claude calls Gemini → Image done
- Need something rewritten → One AI asks another for help

No more tab-switching. No more copy-pasting between tools.

It's free and open source: https://github.com/roeiba/agents-parliament
