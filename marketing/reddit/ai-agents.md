**Title:** Agents Parliament — AI agents that call each other

Hey,

I made an open source project: 🏛️ **Agents Parliament** — AI agents that call each other

Instead of switching between Claude, Gemini, Codex, Aider — let them collaborate.

Ask Claude for an image → Claude calls Gemini → Image generated.
Ask for a refactor → Claude delegates to Aider → Code updated.

Best of every world and every agent - combined.
