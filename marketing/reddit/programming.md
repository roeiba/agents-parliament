**Title:** Agents Parliament — MCP servers for AI agent-to-agent communication

Open-sourced a collection of MCP servers that let AI coding agents invoke each other as tools.

Instead of switching between Claude, Gemini, Codex, Aider — they collaborate.

Ask Claude for an image → Claude calls Gemini → Image generated.
Ask for a refactor → Claude delegates to Aider → Code updated.

Pure Python. Uses Anthropic's MCP SDK. Easy installer.
