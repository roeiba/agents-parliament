**Title:** Agents Parliament — AI agents that collaborate

https://github.com/roeiba/agents-parliament

Instead of switching between Claude, Gemini, and other AI coding tools — they can now call each other.

Ask Claude for an image → Claude calls Gemini → Image done.
Ask for a refactor → Claude delegates to Aider → Code updated.

Best of every AI, combined. Free and open source.
