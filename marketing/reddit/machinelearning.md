**Title:** [P] Agents Parliament — Multi-agent orchestration via MCP

Open-sourced a collection of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable AI coding agents to invoke each other as tools.

**Concept:** Instead of using a single agent, your orchestrator can delegate tasks — Claude calls Gemini for image generation, delegates refactoring to Aider, etc.

**Technical details:**
- Pure Python
- Uses Anthropic's MCP SDK
- Supports: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, Aider, Goose
