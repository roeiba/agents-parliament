**Title:** NYE project: Made AI assistants work together instead of using them separately

Built something over New Year's Eve because I was tired of switching between Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.

**Agents Parliament** — AI assistants that call each other.

**How it works:**
- Ask Claude for an image → Claude calls Gemini → Image appears
- Need a refactor → Claude delegates to a coding specialist → Code updated

Each AI has strengths. Now they combine them automatically.

Open source, free to use.

Looking for feedback — what would you use this for?
