**Title:** AI agents that call each other — a step toward multi-agent collaboration

Built something that lets AI coding assistants invoke each other as tools.

**Example:** Ask Claude for an image. Claude can't generate images — but Gemini can. So Claude calls Gemini, gets the image, returns it to you.

Each agent has different capabilities. Now they can combine them automatically.

Supports Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT/Codex, Aider, and Goose.

Curious what workflows people would want to see with multi-agent collaboration.
