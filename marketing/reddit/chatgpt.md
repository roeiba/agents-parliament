**Title:** Made AI agents call each other — Claude triggers Gemini, delegates to Codex

Built an open source project that lets AI coding agents collaborate instead of you switching between them.

**Example:**
- Ask Claude for an image → Claude calls Gemini → Image done
- Need code execution → Claude delegates to Codex

Supports Claude, Gemini, OpenAI Codex, Aider, and Goose.
