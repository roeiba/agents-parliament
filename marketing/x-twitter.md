🏛️ Agents Parliament — AI agents that call each other

Instead of switching between Claude, Gemini, Codex, Aider — let them collaborate.

Ask Claude for an image → Claude calls Gemini → Image generated 🎨
Ask for a refactor → Claude delegates to Aider → Code updated

Best of every world and every agent - combined.
