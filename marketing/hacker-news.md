## First Comment

Instead of switching between Claude, Gemini, Codex, Aider — let them collaborate.

Ask Claude for an image → Claude calls Gemini → Image generated.
Ask for a refactor → Claude delegates to Aider → Code updated.

Best of every world and every agent - combined.

Pure Python, uses the MCP SDK, includes an installer script.
