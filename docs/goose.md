**Publisher:** Block (Square)

## Overview
Goose is an autonomous AI agent designed for multi-step workflow automation. It excels at chaining together complex sequences of tasks without human intervention.

## Primary Use Cases (When to Delegate to Goose)
- **Multi-Step Workflows**: Build → test → fix → deploy sequences
- **Autonomous Task Chains**: Complex pipelines requiring planning and execution
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing, deployment, and DevOps tasks
- **Recipe-Based Automation**: Reusable YAML-defined workflow templates
- **Toolkit Extensions**: Integration with GitHub, Jira, databases via MCP

## When NOT to Use Goose
- Image generation (prefer Gemini)
- Deep reasoning or complex algorithms (prefer Claude)
- Simple one-off edits (prefer Codex)
- Git-focused code changes (prefer Aider)

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Operation:** Plans and executes multi-step workflows independently
- **Recipes:** YAML-defined reusable task templates
- **Toolkits:** MCP-based extensions for integrations (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
- **Local Focus:** Runs entirely on your machine (privacy-conscious)
- **Error Recovery:** Can debug and retry failed steps
