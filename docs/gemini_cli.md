# Gemini CLI

**Publisher:** Google (Open Source)

## Overview
Gemini CLI is an open-source tool that brings Google's Gemini models (e.g., Gemini 1.5/2.5 Pro) to the terminal. It works as a "Reason and Act" (ReAct) agent capable of complex multi-step tasks.

## Key Features
- **Large Context Window:** Leverages Gemini's massive context window (up to 1M+ tokens) to understand large codebases.
- **Agentic Capabilities:** Can perform Google Searches, read files, and execute shell commands to solve problems autonomously.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Supports extensibility through MCP, allowing it to connect to other tools and data sources.
- **Free Tier:** Generous free usage limits for individual developers using their own API keys.
