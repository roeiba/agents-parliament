# OpenAI Codex CLI

**Publisher:** OpenAI via Community/Open Source (Note: "Codex" is the model, various CLIs exist wrapping it, often referred to as "The OpenAI CLI" or specific wrapper tools).

## Overview
The Codex CLI allows developers to interact with OpenAI's Codex models directly from the terminal. It translates natural language commands into shell commands or code edits.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language Parsing:** Convert English instructions into Git commands, file manipulations, or script execution.
- **Sandboxed Execution:** Some versions offer "full auto" modes that run in a sandboxed environment for safety.
- **Multimodal Support:** Recent iterations support inputs like screenshots (if the CLI wrapper supports it) to guide code generation.
- **Integration:** Often integrated with the broader OpenAI API ecosystem.
